INTRODUCTION

Aaahh... agh... aaeey...

Welcome to the gates of Karmaggän.

The stories of this temple stretch back countless ages, when the first men learned to tame speech. Here, the night was ignited by an impossible light; and a star fell from the sky.

I suppose I should congratulate you: despite the fact that this jungle seems determined to expel you, you’ve made it to the outer wall of the Temple.

You still have time to turn back. You would be among the few who can confirm that Karmaggän exists. Only one account of its interior is known, but everything within it is violent and incomprehensible.

There is something these walls cherish, something that radiates a strange force of attraction in people, leading them to commit the most atrocious acts. Whatever it is you seek to loot inside, it cannot be good for anyone. As time passes, you will feel how bravery becomes recklessness; and how the line between intelligence and cruelty fades away.

Be careful, but promise me you won’t be too careful.
