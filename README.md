DO YOU WANT TO MAKE OTHERS SUFFER?<br/>
OR DO YOU PREFER TO OVERCOME CHAOS AND YOUR RIVALS TO TAKE GLORY? <br/>

I WELCOME YOU TO THE KARMAGGÄN<br/>

Go to the center of the Temple to steal the Alien Egg and get out alive, but it won't be easy. The floor rotates randomly, reconfiguring the board at any time. Traps lurk everywhere and the deadliest threat is other players. If negotiations fail, prepare for fierce real-time combat! <br/>

**DEATH IS NOT THE END.** Dead Reavers will return as Spawns. Here, taking too many risks is as dangerous as not taking risks. <br/>
